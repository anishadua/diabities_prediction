# Diabetes Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health data

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a seamless process for predicting diabetes by building a machine learning model that analyzes various health parameters.

# Project Objectives
The project follows these key steps:

1.Data Gathering: Collected relevant medical data from various sources, including public datasets.
2.Descriptive Analysis: Explored the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and trends.
3.Data Visualizations: Created insightful visualizations to represent key relationships in the data.
4.Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the data for use in the machine learning model.
5.Data Modelling: Trained a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict diabetes.
6.Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using various metrics to ensure accuracy.


# Technical Aspects

# Machine Learning Model
1.Library: scikit-learn
2.Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests (or any chosen algorithms based on your project)
3.Input Features: The following fields are taken from the user:
a.Number of Pregnancies
b.Insulin Level
c.Age
d.Body Mass Index (BMI)
e.Blood Pressure
f.Glucose Level
g.Skin Thickness
h.Diabetes Pedigree Function
4.Output: The model predicts whether the person is likely to have diabetes (Yes/No).
